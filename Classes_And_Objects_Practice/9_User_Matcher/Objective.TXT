Previously we had implemented User Authorization in our application. We had forgotten to implement to check duplicate user details. In our 
application, there can be only one user with a specific mobile number. If two users exist with the same mobile number they are duplicate.How to 
check whether two objects are equal?.Yeah, you are right the equals() method. Go on override the equals method and check if two users are same.

Create User class with following private attributes

Attributes	Datatype
name		String
username	String
password	String
mobileNumber	Long
Include appropriate getters and setters.
Create Default and Parameterized Constructor as User(String name, String username, String password, Long mobileNumber) for the class.
Override equals method that compares mobileNumber of the two objects.

Create a driver class named Main to test the above class.

Note:
Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented Specifications given in the problem statement.All class names, attribute names and method names should be 
the same as specified in the problem statement.
