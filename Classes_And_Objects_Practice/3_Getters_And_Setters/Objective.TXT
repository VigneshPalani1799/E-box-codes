the Fair. The Best application would be used for the fair and the developer gets a cash prize. You are a well versed and aspiring Programmer in 
your city. Many programmers have enrolled themselves for the contest and you are one of them. Every contestant is provided with a Schema diagram

public String getName(){
 return this.name;
}
