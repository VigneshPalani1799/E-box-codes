Now you know to create an object and use getters and setters. Next, we move on to another method of object creation, Constructors. We are going 
to use default and parameterized constructor here.

Create a class StallCategory with following private attributes,

Attribute	 Data Type
name	String
detail	String
Method Name	Description
void display()	This method displays the details of the StallCategory as per specification provided in the sample input & output
 
Include appropriate getters and setters


 Example :
public void setName(String name){
 this.name = name;
}
public String getName(){
 return this.name;
}
Include default and parameterized constructor. Create objects for the class StallCategory in Main class using both and find that there is no 
difference between them.

public StallCategory() - default constructor
public StallCategory(String name, String detail) - parameterised

Note: Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented Specifications given in the problem statement.
All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.
