Now we know how to use the equals() method. Now let's use it in our application to reduce redundancy. Same halls cannot be booked on the same 
date for two different events. So get the halls booked by two different persons and check whether it is same or not. Use equals method to check 
all attributes of the hall are equal including booking date.

Create Hall class with following private attributes
 
Attributes	Datatype
name	String
contactNumber	Long
costPerDay	Double
ownerName	String
bookingDate	Date
Include appropriate getters and setters
Create Default and Parameterized Constructor as Hall(String name, Long contactNumber, Double costPerDay, String ownerName, Date bookingDate) for 
the class.
Override equals method that compares all the fields of the class.

Create a driver class named Main to test the above class.

[Note: Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented Specifications given in the problem statement.All class names, attribute names and method names 
should be the same as specified in the problem statement.]
