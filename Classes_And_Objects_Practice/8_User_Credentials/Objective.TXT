In a typical application, the password will not be stored directly in the database as it will be more prone to attack. The password of users 
will always be stored in encrypted form. To make your application secure, the password has to be in encrypted format. Hence implement a typical 
user authorization technique for login.

Create User class with following private attributes

Attributes	Datatype
id		Integer
username	String
password	String
 

Include appropriate getters and setters
Create Default and Parameterized Constructor as User(Integer id, String username, String password) for the class.

Create UserBO class to validate the username and password with following methods

 

Method Name						Description
User[] getUsers()					This method returns an predefined array of users.

private String encryptPassword(String password)		accepts a single argument of type String and returns the encrypted password by replacing 
							with their next ASCII character. For example, A is replaced with B.

boolean validate(String username, String password)	This method takes username and password entered by the user as parameters and returns 
							boolean after validating.

Create a driver class named Main to test the above class.

Sample user list:     

ID	Username	Password
1	Louis	rxfsuzA2345
2	Messie	hpphmf1:
3	Steve	opefKt
4	Kallis	23456778
5	Wipro	A$%

[Note: Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented Specifications given in the problem statement.All class names, attribute names and method names 
should be the same as specified in the problem statement.]
