Create a class Event with attributes,

Attribute		Data Type
name			String
detail			String
type			String
organiser		String
attendeesCount		Integer
projectedExpenseDouble
Make them as private attributes and add appropriate getters/setters, constructor.
public Event(String name,String detail, String type, String organiser, Integer attendeesCount, Double projectedExpense)

Now let's create a BO (Business Object) class for our event class. Create EventBO to manipulate the objects of the Event class. Create an event 
array in it to store Event objects.

Create following methods inEventBO class,

Method								Description

public void addEvent(Event[] eventArray,Event eventIns)		takes Event array & object and add it to the array.
public Event[] searchEvents(Event[] eventArray, String type)	takes eventArray&type and returns an new array of event objects which are of the 
								type specified. Returns null if there is no events of the specific type.

public void displayAll(Event[] eventArray)			displays all the event details.

CreateMain class and in main method get the number of events, then get their details. Here we also use a new technique of splitting the 
string. Get the details as comma separated line, split it and save it as Event object before sending to BO class to add it in array of objects.

CSV input format: (name,detail,type,organiser,attendeesCount,projectedExpense)

Note: Strictly adhere to the Object Oriented Specifications given in the problem statement.
All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.

Print "No Events available in the given type" in main method if the function returned null.
    Refer sample input/output for other further details and format of the output.
