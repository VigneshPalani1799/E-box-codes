Kudos, your application is progressing really good but its time to add some really cool features to it. Until now you have created single objects
for each class, now there's a need to create an array of objects for a class to enable the search feature. Create an array of ItemType objects.
Also,add a provision for adding a new ItemType object to the array of ItemType objects. Create an interactive console to get input from the 
user for performing different actions on the array.

Create ItemType class as before consisting of the following private attributes.

Attributes	Datatype
name		String
deposit		Double
costPerDay	Double
 

Include appropriate getters and setters for the class.
Include default and parameterized constructors for the class.

Create a class named ItemTypeBO class.
ItemTypeBO class contains the following methods.

Method Name									Description
public void add(ItemType object ,ItemType[] itemTypeArray,Integer index)	This method accepts an array of ItemType objects, an ItemType 
										object and the index at which the object is to be added in the 
										array. The method appends the object to the array of ItemType 
										objects at the specified index and prints "New item added 
										successfully"
public void search(String search, ItemType[] itemTypeArray)			This method accepts search term and the array of ItemType 
										objects as input and displays the details of the ItemType if 
										matched.else prints "Searched Item Type not found"
public void display(ItemType[] itemTypeArray)					This method accepts an array of ItemType objects as input and 
										displays the details one by one.

Create a driver class called Main. In the Main method, obtain input from the console and call the ItemTypeBO functions appropriately.

Note: Display only one digit after a decimal point.
Size of itemType Array should be 10.
The search statement "Enter the Name of the item to be searched" should be in the Main method.
Strictly adhere to the Object-Oriented Specifications given in the problem statement.
All class names, attribute names and method names should be the same as specified in the problem statement.
