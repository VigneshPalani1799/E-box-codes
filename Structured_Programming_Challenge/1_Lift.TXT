The Personalized Gifts store is in the nth floor.

Sita gets into a lift in the ground floor.

The lift that Sita gets in does not stop in all floors. It stops in only 3 floors numbered n1, n2 and n3.

She wants to get down in the floor that is closest to n. If there are 2 choices, she always prefers to climb down the stairs rather than 
climbing up.

Help Sita in deciding the floor she should get down from the lift.

Input Format:

Input consists of 4 integers corresponding to n, n1, n2 and n3.  [n1<n2<n3]

Output Format:

Output consists of an integer that corresponds to the floor number where she would get down.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.
