The next game for the kids was based on Chess Board.

All kids were asked the same question ""How many bishops can be placed on a chessboard without threatening each other? The Chess Board size is 
N*N".

Mahirl wanted to participate in this game too.

Sita knows that a bishop's moves are quite complicated and it is difficult to make a 4â€”year kid understand the bishop moves. A bishop can move 
to any distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop's position.

Sita needs to find a way in which Mahirl could give the correct anwer to this question. Mahirl is good at addition and subtraction. She is not 
familiar with other arithmetic operations yet.

Help Sita to compute the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two bishops threaten each other and 
to make Mahirl win in this game too.
