The Pan Am 73 flight landed at the Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, for an hour-long stopover. Four heavily armed terrorists suddenly 
gathered near the passengers and hijacked Pan Am 73. The passengers started screaming in panic. The terrorists ordered the pssengers to maintain 
silence and threatened their lives. The whole aircraft was in a tremor. The four terrorists took charge  of the various sections. Neerja – the 
flight purser had already been trained on hijack situations. As her first and the most crucial move she has to pass a hijack code to the cockpit.

She quickly picks up the intercom and calls the cockpit and passes the hijack code. The air crew were discussing on what has to be done. 
According to the air crew's protocol they had to flee the aircraft leaving the engine running. But before they could evacuate the cockpit they 
needed to put a lock to the cockpit door. The cockpit lock code was a six digit code in which all digits in the code were prime numbers. Given a 
code check if it a cockpit lock code.

Input Format :
The first line of input is an integer L corresponding to the lock code. 0 < H

Output Format :
The output consists of one line.
Print “Yes” if L is a cockpit lock code else print “No”.
Print “Invalid Input” if the code is out of range.
Refer sample input(s) and output(s) for formatting specifications.
