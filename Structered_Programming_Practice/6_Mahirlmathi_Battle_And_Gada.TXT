The Gada is a heavy rod of iron with one hundred spikes on the top. One of the four cubits was able to destroy elephants and rocks. It
could be handled in twenty different ways. By means of gun powder it could be used as a projectile weapon of war. Its principal use 
was to strike the enemy either from a raised place or from both sides and strike terror into the enemy .
Baahubali and Bhalla Deva are the 2 princes of the kingdom of Mahirlmathi.

When a war is forced upon Mahirlmati by the Kalakeyas, Sivagami, the Queen of Mahirlmathi promises that the new king will be the one 
who beheads the Kalakeya king and orders that the war resources be distributed equally between the two cousins. Bijjala Deva , Bhalla 
Deva's father, uses his cunningness to make sure Bhalladeva gets the maximum war fare.
Baahubali gets Kattapa's help to manufacture few Gadas to be  used in the army during the battle.

However, due to budget and logistic reasons, it's only possible to manufacture 1 Gada per day, which means that for a long time, many 
warriors will be waiting for their Gadas to arrive.

There are N warriors and  K Gadas. Baahubali was thinking about how to distribute these Gadas to the n warriors. He asked the help of 
Mahirl,the renowned mathematical scholar of the land of Mahirlmathi. He asked Mahirl ---  "Imagine that there are N warriors and that there 
are only K Gadas. In how many ways, can I distibute these K Gadas among the warriors, if I see them as being distinct?"
Mahirl replied immediately with the right answer. But Baahubali had another question for the scholar: "Okay Mahirl, as you are so 
fast,now I want you to tell me exactly the same thing, but, with the addition that the value of K is changing, that is, I want you to 
tell me the sum of the number of ways I can distribute  K Gadas, if the value of K goes from 1 (meaning that there are is only 1 Gada)
to N (meaning that there are N Gadas). Can you be as fast now?”

Can you please help Mahirl is answering this question?
